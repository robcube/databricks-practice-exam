 * Demonstration of the Adaptive Question Selection Engine

 * This example shows how the adaptive engine works with different user scenarios:
 * 1. New user with no exam history (balanced distribution)
 * 2. User with weak areas (60% allocation to weak topics)
 * 3. User with improving performance (reduced allocation to strong topics)
